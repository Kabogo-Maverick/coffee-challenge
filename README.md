# Coffee-Shop Challenge

## Project Overview

This Python project models a simple Coffee Shop domain with three core classes:

- **Customer** — represents a coffee shop customer.
- **Coffee** — represents a type of coffee served.
- **Order** — represents an order made by a customer for a specific coffee at a certain price.

### Relationships

- A **Customer** can place many **Orders**.
- A **Coffee** can be ordered many times (many **Orders**).
- Each **Order** belongs to exactly one **Customer** and one **Coffee**.
- This models a many-to-many relationship between **Customer** and **Coffee** through **Orders**.
